   :relevant-api: espressif_sdm_interface

   Fade an LED with the Espressif sigma-delta modulator.

Overview
********

This sample sweeps the pulse density of one sigma-delta channel between -90
and 90. Density zero is about a 50% PDM stream. Higher values spend more time
high, so an LED wired from the GPIO to ground grows brighter and then dims.

The channel sample rate is 1 MHz. Connect an LED and a series resistor between
the GPIO below and ground.

ESP32-C2 and ESP32-C61 have no sigma-delta modulator, so this sample does not
target their devkits.

Building and Running
